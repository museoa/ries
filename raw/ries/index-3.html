<p class="a">
Here are a few cute and/or fun things you can do with <span class="k">ries</span>:
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="classical">Classical Approximations</h3></p>

<p class="a">
The <span class="b">--min-match-distance</span> option tells <span class="k">ries</span> to not report any match
unless it is <span class="i">at least</span> a certain distance from the target. This can
be used to find approximations to known values without hitting on the
exact formula &#8212; like an approximation to &#960;.
</p>
<p class="i">
  Combine this with the <span class="b">-N</span> option to avoid using modern functions
like sine and logarithm, and you get "classical" approximations. For
example, try this command from <a href="doc/ries-manual.txt">the ries manual</a>:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  ries 3.141592653589 -NpSCTlLeEv^ --min-match-distance 1e-10
&#8195;
  Using minimum match distance: 1e-10
&#8195;
     Your target value: T = 3.141592653589                    mrob.com/ries
&#8195;
                     x-3 = 1/6                    for x = T + 0.025074    {60}
                     x-3 = 1/7                    for x = T + 0.00126449  {60}
               sqrt(x-3) = 3/8                    for x = T - 0.000967654 {83}
             x+sqrt(phi) = sqrt(2)+3              for x = T + 0.000601259 {87}
                 1/(x-3) = 5 sqrt(2)              for x = T - 0.000171297 {85}
                 x/phi^2 = 1/5+1                  for x = T + 4.81329e-05 {85}
           (x+1) sqrt(2) = 6-1/7                  for x = T + 3.27791e-05 {103}
                   x^2-x = 8-sqrt(phi)            for x = T - 5.94282e-06 {95}
               1/(x-3)+1 = sqrt(8^2+1)            for x = T + 5.12373e-06 {107}
               (x^2-8)^2 = sqrt(sqrt(5))+2        for x = T - 3.0576e-06  {109}
               1/(x-3)-1 = 1/4^2+6                for x = T + 2.66765e-07 {111}
         (sqrt(x)-1/3)^2 = 5/(sqrt(2)+1)          for x = T - 6.4329e-08  {118}
             x-sqrt(3*7) = sqrt(5)/4-2            for x = T + 3.57418e-08 {131}
  </span>
<p class="a">
The output starts with <span class="i">x</span>=19/6 and <span class="i">x</span>=22/7, the two most common
simple fraction approximations for &#960;.
</p>

<p class="a">
A little bit further is <span class="m">1/(x-3) = 5 sqrt(2)</span>, which turns into thenifty approximation 3+&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">1/50</span> = 3+&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">2</span>/10 = 3.14142135... You can
also spot two others that contain "<span class="m">(x-3)</span>" on the left-hand-side:<span class="m">1/(x-3)+1 = sqrt(8^2+1)</span> and <span class="m">1/(x-3)-1 = 1/4^2+6</span>, both of whichwill solve to <span class="i">x</span> = 3 + <span class="i">something...</span>. The second of these is
also equivalent to 355/113=3.14159292..., an excellent simple
fraction approximant to &#960;.
</p>

<p class="a">
Fans of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">Golden ratio</a> will like <span class="m">x/phi^2 = 1/5+1</span> which gives6&#934;<sup>2</sup>/5 = 3.1416407... We also get
(<span class="i">x</span><sup>2</sup>-8)<sup>2</sup>=sqrt(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">5</span>)+2, which if you solve for <span class="i">x</span> turns into
the nested radical approximation:
</p>

<p class="q">
  
  <img src="radicals-3.14159.gif" alt=""  > = 3.14158959... = &#960; - 3.057&times;10<sup>-6</sup>
</p>
<p class="a">

for related (and more devious) tricks <a href="#dr_matrix">see below</a>...
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="pre_destiny">Mystical Pre-Destiny</h3></p>

<p class="a">
Take your phone number and a friend's phone number and insert a
decimal point: 123-4567 becomes 123.4567 and 555-1212 becomes
555.1212. Then take the ratio: 555.1212/123.4567 = 4.496485. Put
this into <span class="k">ries</span> and pick a formula that can be solved for <span class="i">x</span> (for
example, I used <span class="i">x</span>+<sup>9</sup>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">&#960;</span>=6-1/<span class="i">e</span>). Solve it for <span class="i">x</span> (in this
case getting <span class="i">x</span>=6-1/<span class="i">e</span>-<sup>9</sup>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">&#960;</span>), and then multiply the whole
thing by the phone number that you originally put in the denominator
and you get the other phone number:
</p>

<p class="q">
  (6 - 1/<span class="i">e</span> - <sup>9</sup>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">&#960;</span>) &times; 123.4567 = 555.121234525
</p>
<p class="a">

If the answer doesn't have all 7 digits, try another of the formulas
that <span class="k">ries</span> gave. If you don't find a nice formula, start with
something else, like 5.551212+1.234567 or 5.551212-1.234567, and
transform the result in the appropriate way.
</p>

<p class="a">
Now go to your friend and announce that you have found the mystic
formula that links their phone number to yours. For extra credit,
write the formula in an old school notebook and claim it was given as
a problem in class long before you met.
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="four">Four Fours</h3></p>

<p class="a">
At one time this type of problem was popular: How do you reach various
values using four 4's and any number of symbols (for example:
44/44&#8195;=&#8195;1, 4/4+4/4&#8195;=&#8195;2, (4+4+4)/4&#8195;=&#8195;3, etc.). Solutions of
a similar type of problem can be found with the --numeric-anagram
option:
</p>

<p class="q">
   <span class="m"> ries '-S+-*/' --numeric-anagram 4444 -Ox 17 </span> <br />
 | x = 4*4+4/4 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; ('exact' match) |
</p>
<p class="a">

giving the solution 4&times;4+4/4&#8195;=&#8195;17. The <span class="m">-S+-*/</span>option specifies the "symbols" that can be used in solutions, and the
quotes around it prevent the shell from performing filename globbing.
<span class="m">--numeric-anagram 4444</span> specifies that up to four 4's can be used insolutions (however fewer is allowed). <span class="m">-Ox</span> tells <span class="b">ries</span> that <span class="m">x</span>should only appear once in each equation. Although the 17 example and
some others happen to have four 4's, solutions with fewer might be
found:
</p>

<p class="q">
   <span class="m"> ries '-S+-*/' --numeric-anagram 4444 -Ox 5 </span> <br />
 | x = 4/4+4 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; ('exact' match) |
</p>
<p class="a">

</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="code">Secret Code</h3></p>

<p class="a">
Convert letters to numbers, generate an equation with <span class="b">ries</span>, convert
to an expression, then transmit to your friends. They use a calculator
as the "secret decoder ring". Not very efficient, but pretty darn
obscure.
</p>

<p class="a">
Example: Convert "D A V E" to numbers (D=04, A=01, V=22, E=05). Make
this to a single number (4.012205). Since we want to match <span class="i">all</span> the
digits and we don't care what digits come after that, use the option
<span class="b">--mad</span> which is short for <span class="b">--match-all-digits</span>. We'll also use
<span class="b">-NSCT</span> to avoid trigonometric functions. Typing
<span class="m">ries 4.012205 --mad -NSCT</span> gives a few answers including theequation <span class="m">sqrt(x^2-5) = 4&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">&#960;</span>+2</span> Solving for <span class="i">x</span> gives<span class="i">x</span>=<span class="b">sqrt(5+(sqrt(sqrt(&#960;))+2)^2)</span>. The value is
<span class="b">4.01 22 05</span> 79... which has the needed encoding of "DAVE".
</p>

<p class="a">
If your friend's calculator does not have a &#960; key or other
scientific functions, exclude more things with the <span class="m">-N</span> option, forexample, <span class="m">ries 4.012205 --mad -NSCTplLfveE^</span>.</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="area_51">Area 51</h3></p>

<p class="a">
Sadly, as I mentioned in the <a href="index-2.html#history">history of RIES</a>, a lot of
the reason for <span class="k">ries</span>'s existence is to answer the frequent emails I
get from... let's call them "dreamers". These are the folks who are
obsessed with finding the mathematical equivalent of the mythical
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth">Fountain of Youth</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression">closed-form expression</a> (using elementary
functions) for some mysterious thing in the universe. The
quintessential example is the
<a href="../../pub/num/n-b137_035.html#cult_137">Sommerfeld fine-structure constant</a>. In an
earlier age the biggest problem was claims of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle">squaring the circle</a>,
akin to a claim that &#960; is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_number">constructible</a>.
</p>
<p class="i">
  When I get an email from one of these folks I usually invoke a <span class="k">ries</span>
command like this:
</p>

<p class="q">
  <span class="m">ries -l5 --try-solve-for-x --mad 137.03599907</span></p>
<p class="a">

which happily reports "<span class="m">x = (1/ln((sqrt(4-sqrt(e))+2)/3))^e</span>". If wewish to keep the aliens away, we could broadcast this formula into
space, and they'd think we're
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive">not advanced enough to be ready for interstellar contact</a>.
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="dr_matrix">A Visit by Dr. Matrix</h3></p>

<p class="a"><span class="i">Scientific American</span> maths columnist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin Gardner</a> often
referred to novel ideas and fringe theories attributed to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Joshua_Matrix">Dr. Matrix</a>, usually with humorous intent.
Perhaps the best known example was
<a href="../../pub/math/numbers-17.html#ram_constant">Ramanujan's constant</a>, which "Doctor Matrix"
claimed to be an integer. We can use <span class="k">ries</span> (perhaps in an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">April Fool's</a> stunt) to put forth similar claims.
</p>
<p class="i">
  For example, try the command
</p>

<p class="q">
  <span class="m">ries 3.141592653589 -NpSCT -l5</span></p>
<p class="a">

which simply tells <span class="k">ries</span> to find approximations for &#960; without
using &#960; itself or the trigonometric functions. Look at the results
and pick one you like, then turn it around into something you can type
on a calculator. I like <span class="m">1/(x-3)-1/2 = e sqrt(2)+e</span> because itcontains "<span class="m">x-3</span>" which means that when you solve for <span class="i">x</span> the formulawill start with "<span class="i">x</span> = 3 + ...". Then blog or text to your friends:
</p>

<p class="q">
  <span class="i"><span class="m">My friend Irving said to try this on my TI-89:
  3+2/(1+e&times;(2+&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">8</span>)). What do you get?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="a">

</p><h3>The Return of Dr. Matrix</h3>

<p class="a">
For a little more sophistication, try the command:
</p>

<p class="q">
  <span class="m">ries 3.141592653589 --min-match-distance 1e-8 -NSCT</span></p>
<p class="a">

This tells <span class="k">ries</span> to find formulas for &#960; so long as the solution
isn't within 10<sup>-8</sup> of your given value, and excluding the trig
functions but allowing &#960; itself. Since &#960; is not excluded as a
symbol, this gives us formulas for &#960; that use &#960; as part of the
formula, but a direct approach like <span class="i">x</span>=&#960; is not allowed because we
gave the <span class="b">--min-match-distance</span> option.
</p>
<p class="i">
  Among the output of this example are the equations <span class="i">x</span>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">&#960;+1</span> =
<span class="i">e</span><sup>3</sup>/&#960; and <span class="i">x</span><sup>2</sup>/<span class="i">e</span><sup>3</sup> = 1/&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">1+pi</span>. By substituting <span class="i">x</span>
for any &#960;'s in the formula and rearranging to get just one <span class="i">x</span> on
the left-hand side, both of these can be made into:
</p>

<p class="q">
   <span class="i">x</span>=(<span class="i">e</span><sup>6</sup>/(<span class="i">x</span>+1))<sup>(1/4)</sup>
</p>
<p class="a">

If iterated with any starting value for <span class="i">x</span>, this happens to converge
(but it does <span class="i">not</span> converge on &#960;). Use it in a joke blog article:
</p>

<p class="q">
  <span class="i">Dr. Matrix visited me early last April. He claimed to have found
  an interesting converging iterative formula. Start with any value for
  <span class="i">x</span>, such as 17 (the doctor's favourite number). Then calculate the
  value of the formula</span>
</p>
<p class="a">

</p>
<p class="q">
                       </p><br /><p align="center"><img src="Dr-Matrix-e6-formula.gif" alt="" title="" ><br /><i></i></p><br />
<p class="a">

</p>
<p class="q">
  <span class="i">Use the result as a new value for <span class="i">x</span>, and repeat. Dr. Matrix
  told me that if I continue this process several more times, I would
  get a recognisable result. He plans to publish a proof of this
  remarkable formula in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Improbable_Research">Annals of Improbable Research</a>
  later this year.
</span></p>
<p class="a"><span class="i">

</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="i">
  I tried this out, using my trusty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_SR-50">SR-50</a> scientific calculator.
  Starting with <span class="m">17</span> in the place of <span class="i">x</span> in the formula, add 1,  hit the = sign (18: so far, so good), then use the 1/<span class="i">x</span> key to get
  the reciprocal, and multiply this by <span class="i">e</span><sup>6</sup> (using the <span class="i">e<sup>x</sup></span> key).
  Then press the &#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">x</span> (square root) key twice. I get:
</span></p>
<p class="a"><span class="i">

</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="i">
  &#8195; &#8195; &#8195; <span class="m">5.603177687</span></span></p>
<p class="a"><span class="i">

</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="i">
  Using this new value in the place of <span class="i">x</span>, repeat the formula
  again, and so on:
</span></p>
<p class="a"><span class="i">

<p class="q"><span class="i">

  You might want to try this yourself. The digits eventually
