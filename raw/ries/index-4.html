<p class="a"><h2 id="serious">Semiserious Math Tricks</h2></p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="hypotheses">Formal Hypothesis</h3></p>

<p class="a">
Some fairly serious maths has been done partly with the aid of RIES.
For example, in 2014 December is was
<a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1084897/can-i-get-a-closed-form-of-frac-zeta2-2-frac-zeta-423-frac-zet">asked</a>
if there is a closed form for
</p>

<p class="q">
  SIGMA<sub><span class="i">k</span>=1..inf</sub> [ -1<sup>(<span class="i">k</span>+1)</sup> &#950;(2<span class="i">k</span>) / 2<sup>(2<span class="i">k</span>-1)</sup>  ]
    = &#950;(2)/2 - &#950;(4)/2<sup>3</sup> + &#950;(6)/2<sup>5</sup> - ...
</p>
<p class="a">

where &#950;() is the Riemann Zeta function. The series converges
quickly and <span class="k">ries</span> was used to find a guess for the answer:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  $ ries 0.712688574959647755609169086586
&#8195;
   Your target value: T = 0.712688574959647756                   mrob.com/ries
&#8195;
     x = sqrt(1/2)                               for x = T - 0.00558179  {44}
     x = e^-(1/3)                                for x = T + 0.00384274  {57}
     x = sqrt(5)/pi                              for x = T - 0.000926032 {60}
  [...]
     x = pi/(e^pi-1)-(1-pi/2)                    ('exact' match)         {128}

        Total equations tested:              8984751512 (8.985e+09)
  </span>
<p class="a">
The answer is &#960;/2 coth(&#960;/2) - 1 = &#960;/(<span class="i">e</span>^&#960;-1) + &#960;/2 -
1, and can be proven reasonably easily using the series sum definition
of the Zeta function, an identity (based on the calculus of residues)
for the cotangent, and the simple identity coth <span class="i">x</span> = <span class="i">i</span> cot(<span class="i">ix</span>).
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="wild_guess">Wild Guessing</h3></p>

<p class="a">
This is ostensibly the primary purpose of <span class="k">ries</span>: using some
approximate measurement or calculation as the basis of a "wild guess"
at an exact solution.
</p>
<p class="i">
  Here is an example: <a href="http://xkcd.com/356/">xkcd 356</a> presents an
"infinite grid of resistors" problem that looks like it should have a
closed-form solution, but with no partucularly obvious way to find it.
</p>
<p class="i">
  Matthew Beckler performed
<a href="http://www.mbeckler.org/resistor_grid/">circuit simulations</a> of a
number of grids ranging in size from the minimal set of 7 resistors up
to 80 thousand. As the size of the simulated grid grows, the answer
gets closer to what it should be for an infinite grid. His last 4
answers were: ..., 0.7743, 0.7735, 0.7733, 0.7733. One might guess
that the limit, and true answer to the resistor problem, is somewhere
around 0.7732 or 0.7733. Let's tell <span class="k">ries</span> to search around 0.77325,
with a maximum error of 0.0001:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  ries 0.77325 --max-match-distance 0.0001 -x
&#8195;
  First match must be closer than 0.0001.
&#8195;
     Your target value: T = 0.77325                           mrob.com/ries
&#8195;
                x+1/2 = 4/pi                 for x = 0.773239544735163     {74}
            (x+phi)^2 = 3+e                  for x = 0.773258931086369     {81}
              1/x+1/3 = 4"/7                 for x = 0.773249747663235     {89}
  ...
  </span>
<p class="a">
Thus the simplest "wild guess" answer seems to be 4/&#960;-1/2 =
0.773239... ohms. As
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/resistorgrid/">others</a>
<a href="http://pds4.egloos.com/pds/200708/06/25/resist-zariski.pdf">eventually</a>
<a href="http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=16104&start=120#p434816">showed</a>,
that is indeed the answer.
</p>
<p class="i">
  However this was a pretty lucky guess. We could have guessed that the
answer is within 0.001 of the final measurement 0.7733, and <span class="k">ries</span>
would have told us the answer was &#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">&#960;</span>-1 = 0.772453... To someone
making a wild guess, this appears at least as believable as
4/&#960;-1/2, which illustrates why wild guessing with <span class="k">ries</span> isn't
actually all that useful.
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="newton">Successive Refinement (Newton-Raphson Method)</h3></p>

<p class="a">
Because <span class="k">ries</span> uses derivatives to report how far an inequality
deviates from an (exact) equality, you can use it to iterate Newton's
Method. Suppose you know that the cube root of 3 starts with the
digits 1.442, and want to find more digits. <span class="m">ries 1.442</span> yields theresult:
</p>

<p class="q">
   <span class="m"> x^3 = 3 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; for X = T + 0.000<span class="b">24957</span> {51} </span></p>
<p class="a">

To get a better approximation, add 1.442 and 0.00024957:
</p>

<p class="q">
   <span class="m">ries 1.442<span class="b">24957</span></span> <br />
 <span class="i">(other answers not shown)</span>
 <br />
 | x^3 = 3 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; for x = T + <span class="b">3.07408</span>e-10 {51} |
</p>
<p class="a">

Then add 3.07408&times;10<sup>-10</sup> (notice you have to add a zero):
</p>

<p class="q">
   <span class="m">ries 1.44224957<span class="b">0307408</span></span> <br />
 <span class="i">(other answers not shown)</span>
 <br />
 | x^3 = 3 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; for x = T + 2.22045e-16 {51} |
 <br />
 &#8195;
 <br />
 <span class="i">(and so on...)</span>
</p>
<p class="a">

<span class="k">ries</span> uses about 16 digits in its internal calculations, so this is
about as precise as you can get. The actual value of the cube root of
3 (to 25 digits) is 1.4422495703074083823216383... Although this
specific example is a case of extreme computational overkill, the same
method can be used for things that cannot be computed directly, such
as the value of <a href="../../pub/math/numbers-2.html#l2_50618"><span class="i">x</span> for which <span class="i">x<sup>x</sup></span>=10</a>.
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="identity">Forgotten Identities</h3></p>

<p class="a">
If you're like most people who took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry">Trigonometry</a> in high school,
you remember that there was something called
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities">trigonometric identities</a>", but
nothing more. Maybe you remember that sine could be turned into cosine
somehow, but that's about it.
</p>
<p class="i">
  With <span class="k">ries</span> you can rediscover all the identities, and probably a few
more you never knew existed. For this example we'll use a
<a href="index.html#profile">profile</a> called "rad.ries":
</p>

  <span class="p">
  # rad.ries:  Use trigonometry functions in radians
  --trig-argument-scale 1    # radians
  -NLleEv      # No log, ln, e, e^x or arbitrary roots
  </span>
<p class="a">
Using a calculator (or a command like
<span class="b">ries -prad.ries 1 --eval-expression 1S</span>) you can find out the
sine of 1 radian, which is 0.841470984807897. Naturally, if you give
<span class="k">ries</span> this number, it will tell you:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  ries -prad.ries 0.841470984807897
                x = sin(1)               for x = T - 4.44089e-16 {38}
  </span>
<p class="a">
We want to discover other ways to get the same value without using the
sine function. To do this we simply tell <span class="k">ries</span> that sin() is not
allowed using the <span class="b">-NS</span> option:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  ries -prad.ries 0.841470984807897 -NS
         x/cos(1) = tan(1)               for x = T - 4.44089e-16 {66}
  </span>
<p class="a">
So <span class="k">ries</span> has told us that our number <span class="i">x</span> (which we know to be the
sine of 1) divided by the cosine of 1 is equal to the tangent of 1.
Therefore sin(1)/cos(1) = tan(1). Going back to your calculator, you
can verify that sin(<span class="i">x</span>)/cos(<span class="i">x</span>) = tan(<span class="i">x</span>) for lots of values of
<span class="i">x</span>. This is our first trigonometric identity.
</p>
<p class="i">
  Let's find another one: while still using the target value
0.841470984807897, exclude the tangent function too:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  ries -prad.ries 0.841470984807897 -NST
            x^2-1 = -(cos(1)^2)          for x = T - 4.44089e-16 {78}
  </span>
<p class="a">
Move things around a bit with a little algebra, and this tells us that
sin(1)<sup>2</sup> + cos(1)<sup>2</sup> = 1, which generalises into another identity:
sin<sup>2</sup><span class="i">x</span>+cos<sup>2</sup><span class="i">x</span>=1. (The square of a trig function is usually
written "sin<sup>2</sup><span class="i">x</span>" rather than "sin(<span class="i">x</span>)<sup>2</sup>" or "(sin(<span class="i">x</span>))<sup>2</sup>"
because the latter is a bit cluttered and the other might be confused
with "sin(<span class="i">x</span><sup>2</sup>)").
