<h2 id="background">RIES Background and Philosophy</h2></p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="history">Motivation and History</h3></p>

<p class="a">
I wrote <span class="k">ries</span> after I was frustrated by services such as
<a href="http://oldweb.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html">Plouffe's Inverter</a>
and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_Symbolic_Calculator">Inverse Symbolic Calculator</a>. In case you're wondering, the
things that frustrated me are described <a href="quibbles.html">here</a>. I had
also been getting occasional emails from members of the
<a href="../../pub/num/n-b137_035.html#cult_137">Cult of 137</a>, and like-minded people claiming
formulae for such things as the
<a href="../../pub/muency/areaofthemandelbrotset.html">area of the Mandelbrot set</a>. I thought
it would be nice to be able to demonstrate how easy it is to find a
formula for any number.
</p>

<p class="a">
After a particularly inspired email missive from a person who had
a magic unproven formula for some number, I decided to write <span class="k">ries</span>
and had a working equation-generator within about 2 weeks
(Feb 7<sup>th</sup> through 21<sup>st</sup>, 2000).
</p>

<p class="a">
The program had its own page at <span class="m">mrob.com/ries/index.html</span> at least asearly as Aug 18<sup>th</sup> 2000. Soon I moved it to Earthlink, at
<span class="m">home.earthlink.net/~mrob/pub/ries/index.html</span>, where it remained forseveral years, before moving back to mrob.com at its present location,
<span class="m">mrob.com/pub/ries/index.html</span>. (Old <span class="k">ries</span> pages at these URLs can beseen at <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">archive.org</a>).
</p>

<p class="a">
The core functionality and implementation have remained the same,
although various new features and options were added in late 2011 and
early 2012, and more in 2013.
</p>

<p class="a">
In April 2012, <span class="k">ries</span> was used by Randall Munroe for
<a href="http://xkcd.com/1047">an xkcd strip</a>. In response to growing
interest, I added the <a href="en-query.html">Online RIES server</a>.
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3></p>

<p class="a">
Think of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number">Real number</a>s as being points in space (not arranged
along a straight line, as is more commonly taught). Instead of placing
them close to each other based on their actual value, imagine the real
numbers are close together if they have a simple algebraic
relationship. Think of them as being connected by lines whenever two
real numbers have a simple relationship. Two real numbers with a
simple relationship are like cities on a map, connected by roads. For
example, the numbers 2 and 3 would be connected because they differ by
exactly 1, and the numbers &#960; and 1/&#960; would be connected because
they are reciprocals. This abstract "map" of real numbers connected by
lines is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29">graph</a> in the branch of
mathematics called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>.
</p>

<p class="a">
Somewhere on this infinite graph, which has a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_%28graph_theory%29">vertex</a> for every real number, is the
"mystery number" specified by the user of the <span class="k">ries</span> program. This
number is called the <span class="b">Target</span>.
</p>

<p class="a">
Perhaps we could explore the infinite graph by starting with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer">integer</a>s on the left and the Target on the right. As we explore the
graph we start with very simple operations, like adding or subtracting
1:
</p>

<p class="a">

</p><br /><p align="center"><img src="../../pub/math/images/ries/ries-graph-1.png" width=512  alt="left: a few integers; right: the target T along with T&#177;1" title="left: a few integers; right: the target T along with T&#177;1" ><br /><i>left: a few integers; right: the target T along with T&#177;1</i></p><br />
<p class="a">
Next we try negating values, or taking the reciprocal:
</p>

<br /><p align="center"><img src="../../pub/math/images/ries/ries-graph-2.png" width=512  alt="Some negatives and reciprocals" title="Some negatives and reciprocals" ><br /><i>Some negatives and reciprocals</i></p><br />
<p class="a">
We can also use square root or more exotic functions, and two values
on the graph can be combined (such as by adding or multiplying) to
make new values:
</p>

<br /><p align="center"><img src="../../pub/math/images/ries/ries-graph-3.png" width=512  alt="More possibilities and combinations" title="More possibilities and combinations" ><br /><i>More possibilities and combinations</i></p><br />
<p class="a">
Continuing in this manner, we make more and more different values. It
is clear that eventually we will find a value on the left that is very
close (numerically) to some value on the right. Will we ever find an
exact equality?
</p>

<br /><p align="center"><img src="../../pub/math/images/ries/ries-graph-4.png" width=512  alt="Search for an equality: Do any of the paths meet?" title="Search for an equality: Do any of the paths meet?" ><br /><i>Search for an equality: Do any of the paths meet?</i></p><br />
<p class="a">
If we could find such a path, we would have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation">equation</a>, whose
solution or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function">root</a> would give an exact
representation (and perhaps a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression">closed-form expression</a>) for the target number
<span class="i">T</span>. If we could find the <span class="i">shortest path</span> then we would have the
<span class="i">simplest</span> exact representation of the target number.
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="exact_unlikely">An Exact Answer is Unlikely</h3></p>

<p class="a">
I suggested that all the real numbers are on a graph like this.
However the graph is infinite and there are limits to what can be
reached in a finite number of steps. It has been shown that not all
real numbers are connected by the "algebraic" operations, like
subtraction, division and square root. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number">transcendental number</a>s
far outnumber the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number">algebraic number</a>s. Furthermore, even if we add
constants like &#960; and <span class="i">e</span>, plus more functions like natural
logarithm and cosine, making some transcendental numbers reachable,
there will always be an infinity of real numbers that we'll never
reach. That is because we only have a finite number of options at each
step, and we are only taking a finite number of steps, so the total
number of combinations of operations, and thus reachable nodes, will
always be the "countable infinity" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_null">Aleph null</a> &#8212; the same as the
number of integers. The real numbers are a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_%28set_theory%29">continuum</a>, a set with more than Aleph<sub>0</sub>
members.
</p>

<p class="a">
Since there might be no finite path connecting the fundamental
constants like the integers and &#960; to the target number (or
equivalently, a path that converges on the target might be infinitely
long), <span class="k">ries</span> cannot hope to always find an exact match. However,
paths of finite length should be able to come arbitrarily close to the
target value. (Numerical roundoff error will often cause an 'exact'
match, and these might or might not correspond to actual mathematical
equality.)
</p>

<p class="a">
The central <span class="k">ries</span> algorithm is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search">bidirectional search</a> (see also
<a href="index-6.html#fn_poole2010">[5]</a>) of a graph similar to the search illustrated in the
figures above. The graph is traversed in a "breadth-first" manner,
starting with the shortest paths and gradually extending the
boundaries of explored space (sometimes called "iterative deepening").
Ideally <span class="k">ries</span> would generate all possible
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_%28mathematics%29">expressions</a> in order of increasing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a>. The actual algorithm is a practical
approximation to this.
</p>

<p class="a">
A true bidirectional search requires that the two "search frontiers"
eventually meet. <span class="k">ries</span> cannot guarantee that: as already mentioned,
only a countable number of solutions could ever be reached by its
search. So <span class="k">ries</span> reports close matches, and ensures that each
reported result is "closer" than any reported so far.
</p>

<p class="a"><span class="k">ries</span> explores the graph for short paths that start at the target
number, and simultaneously it looks at short paths starting from
fundamental constants like 1 and &#960;. While it explores, it "marks"
every spot it has visited by adding an entry into a database in
memory. The database is kept sorted by value: in the example
illustrated above, the entry for 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> will be close to the entry
for the target value 2.5063. Whenever <span class="k">ries</span> finds two values that are
closer than anything it has found so far, it reports an equation that
expresses a newer, better approximation to the target.
</p>

<p class="a">
Since <span class="k">ries</span> is exploring <span class="i">expressions</span>, and its bidirectional search
finds two paths that meet somewhere in the middle, any approximation
<span class="k">ries</span> finds is in effect an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation">equation</a> whose
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function">root</a> constitutes an approximation to the
target. For example, on the left we will eventually compute 2&#960; =
6.2831... and on the right we'll compute <span class="i">T</span><sup>2</sup> = 6.2815... Combining
these into an equation gives <span class="i">T</span><sup>2</sup> = 2&#960;, and the solution of that
equation is <span class="i">T</span>=&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">2&#960;</span> = 2.5066... which is not exactly the target
value 2.5063, but it's a lot closer than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

<p class="a">
There is a staggering amount of calculation that might be needed to
find a close match. If the matches were distributed randomly, then it
might take a million failed attempts before finding a single example
that matches to within 6 significant digits. The bidirectional search
approach helps with this, and <span class="k">ries</span> incorporates extensive design for
efficiency, with multiple levels of abstraction and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_%28decision_trees%29">pruning</a> at each level. A match to within
10 significant digits is usually attainable in just a few seconds.
</p>

<p class="a">
A detailed example of the search for a formula for 2.5063, showing the
actual values <span class="k">ries</span> calculates as it searches, is shown in detail
below: <a href="index-6.html#alg_example">A Detailed Example of the RIES Algorithm</a>.
</p>

<p class="a"><h3 id="optims">Optimising the Bidirectional Search</h3></p>

<p class="a"><span class="k">ries</span> does not generate full expressions and then evaluate each one;
it evaluates each symbol as it goes along. This allows it to avoid
repeating calculations when multiple expressions have common parts.
For example it goes from &#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">7</span>+1 to &#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">7</span>-1 without repeating the
calculation of &#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">7</span>.
</p>

<p class="a"><span class="k">ries</span> uses a stack-based execution design, but preserving function
arguments when they are "popped" off the stack so they can be pushed
back on for re-use. To accomplish this I use the "meta-stack"
abstraction, so-called because it is used like a "stack of stacks".
One can also think of it as a stack with an undo list, itself a sort
of stack: whenever something is pushed or popped on the normal stack,
the "undo instructions" are pushed onto the "undo stack"; and when you
"un-push" or "un-pop" it pops instructions off the undo stack and
alters the normal stack accordingly.
</p>

<p class="a">
Millions of expressions need to be generated, and stored in memory so
that <span class="k">ries</span> can display an answer in symbolic form when it finds a
match. For memory efficiency the expressions are as strings of
one-byte symbols, in postfix format so that no extra storage is needed
for parentheses. For example, "&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">7</span>+1" is represented in postfix as
"7 &#8730; 1 +", which is encoded in ASCII as <span class="m">7q1+</span>.</p>

<p class="a"><span class="k">ries</span> needs to give different "weights" to the various digits,
constants and functions in order to produce output that makes sense.
(For example, 4<sup>7</sup> should be thought of as "more complex" than 4&times;7,
which itself is "more complex" than 4+7).
</p>

<p class="a">
Since <span class="k">ries</span> wants to perform iterative deepening, and do so in such a
way as to generate expressions approximately in order of increasing
score (as measured by the sum of the "weights" of the symbols in each
expression). This means that the iterative deepening cannot simply
generate all 1-symbol expressions, then all 2-symbol expressions, and
so on. Instead the deepening needs to look at the complexity score
(sum of weights) of partial expressions and see if it's possible to
lengthen each partial expression without exceeding the complexity
score. This depends on the number of additional symbols that might be
needed to complete the expression. That could be measured by looking at
the number of items on the expression's stack, but I decided instead to
generate expression "forms" that are used as "templates" to generate
expressions whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree">binary expression tree</a> is identical.
</p>

<p class="a">
In expression "forms", the letter "a" represents a scalar value (like
7 or &#960;), a "b" represents a function of one argument (like sine or
square root), and a "c" represents a function of two arguments. For
example the form corresponding to the postfix expression <span class="m">7q1+</span> is"abac".
</p>

<p class="a">
The forms are also generated by iterative deepening. Given a length
<span class="i">n</span>, all forms of length <span class="i">n</span> are generated recursively, with pruning
when an initial substring cannot be completed in length <span class="i">n</span>. (It
is equivalent to generating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motzkin_number">Motzkin number</a>s.)

Several readers have suggested that <span class="k">ries</span> be enhanced to consider several

</p>

<p class="a"><span class="k">ries</span> is as fast as it is only because it uses a
<a href="http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_65.html">bidirectional search</a>. It
cannot count on the two searches ever "meeting" (there is unlikely to

a technique femiliar to those who have done rational approximation by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">continued fraction</a>s. Anything it finds is given a "closeness
rating", and each next answer must be better. It must use derivatives,
so that the "closeness" is normalised to be expressed in terms of the
"unknown" or "target" value.
</p>

<p class="a">
For <span class="k">ries</span> to simultaneously consider multiple unknown or "target"
values, each new match would embody formula(s) for one or more of the
unknowns. The algorithm must consider the derivatives of each formula
with respect to each unknown. If there are 2 unknowns, there will be 4
derivatives; if 3 unknowns, there will be 9 derivatives, and so on.
</p>

<p class="a">
There is a need to take these multiple pieces of information and
combine them into a single "closeness" value that can be used to make
the successive-refinement bidirectional search work. One technique
that does something like this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares_adjustment">least squares adjustment</a> with
more degrees of freedom than dependencies; an example application is
the
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants">CODATA physical constants</a>.
<span class="k">ries</span> would need to be told how the unknowns are related to each
other (for example, <span class="i">b</span>/<span class="i">a</span> is proportional to <span class="i">c</span><sup>2</sup>).
</p>

<p class="a">
I cannot suggest an algorithm for such a task, but I doubt it would
bear much resemblance to <span class="k">ries</span>.

<p class="a">
Use the <span class="k">ries</span> option <span class="m">-i</span> to search for a solution that entirelyinvolves integers. For example:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  ries -i 1729
&#8195;
     Your target value: T = 1729                        mrob.com/ries

                (x-1)/3 = (4*6)^2          ('exact' match)         {97}
                 9(x+1) = 5^6              for x = T + 6.11111     {93}
                  x+6^2 = (6*7)^2          for x = T - 1           {95}

                 4(x-6) = (9^2+2)^2        for x = T - 0.75        {112}
                 4(x-7) = (9^2+2)^2        for x = T + 0.25        {112}
              3*(3 x)^2 = 2*7^9            for x = T - 0.0823981   {122}
                                   . . .
  </span>
<p class="a">
In an integer search, the equations that <span class="k">ries</span> gives, when treated as
inequalities, evaluate to integers on both sides of the = sign. For
example, in the first answer "9<span class="i">x</span>=5<sup>6</sup>", put in the target number
(1729) for <span class="i">x</span> and the left side is 9&times;1729=15561, and the
right-hand-side is 5<sup>6</sup>=15625. This is a near-equality; <span class="k">ries</span> also
tells us that if <span class="i">x</span> is 7.11111... (7 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>) higher, the equation
works out: 9&times;(1729+7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>) = 9&times;1729+9&times;7+1 = 15625.
</p>
<p class="i">
  The second solution "(<span class="i">x</span>-1)/3 = (4*6)<sup>2</sup>" is an exact match,
because (1729-1)/3 is 576, which is 24<sup>2</sup>. If you want <span class="k">ries</span> to give
you <span class="i">only</span> the exact match for an integer problem, use the option
<span class="m">--max-match-distance 0</span>, meaning that no match should be more than 0from equality:
</p>

  <span class="p">
  ries -i 1729 --max-match-distance 0
&#8195;
  Only give an 'exact' match (if any) then exit.

<p class="a">
In his 1998 paper <span class="i">What is a closed-form number?</span> <a href="index-6.html#fn_chow1998">[4]</a>,
Timothy Chow describes several definitions of classes of numbers. He
starts by describing the difference between "closed-form function" and
"closed-form number":
</p>

<p class="q">
  <span class="s">
  Recall that a function is <span class="i">elementary</span> if it can be constructed using
  only a finite combination of constant functions, field operations,
  and algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic functions. [...]
</span></p>
<p class="a"><span class="s">

</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="s">
  what we need [...] is a notion of a closed-form <span class="i">number</span> rather than a
  closed-form <span class="i">function</span>. The distinction is important; we cannot, for
  example, simply define an "elementary number" to be any number
  obtainable by evaluating an elementary function at a point, because
  all constant functions are elementary, and this definition would make
  all numbers elementary. [...]
</span></p>
<p class="a"><span class="s">

</span></p>
<p class="q"><span class="s">
  Intuitively, "closed-form" implies "explicit", and most algebraic
  functions have no simple explicit expression. So the set of purely
  transcendental elementary functions is a better prototype for our
  purposes than the set of elementary functions. ("Purely
  transcendental" simply means that the word "algebraic" is dropped
  from the definition.)
  </span> <br />
 &#8195; &#8195; - Chow 1998 <a href="index-6.html#fn_chow1998">[4]</a>
</p>
<p class="a">

In this description, the term <span class="i">algebraic functions</span> is being used
as in the Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_function">Algebraic function</a>. It is not a
"function" in the ordinary way, where you put in a number and get a
single number out. Rather, it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation">binary relation</a> between <span class="i">x</span> and <span class="i">y</span>
such that all valid pairs of <span class="i">x</span> and <span class="i">y</span> satisfy an equation like:

<p class="q">
  <span class="i">P</span><sub><span class="i">n</span></sub>(<span class="i">y</span>)<span class="i">x<sup>n</sup></span> + ...

where each of the <span class="i">P</span><sub><span class="i">i</span></sub>(<span class="i">y</span>) is a normal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial">polynomial</a>. This
includes a lot of things, like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_function">quintic polynomials</a> in <span class="i">x</span>, that cannot usually
be solved for <span class="i">x</span> in closed form. This is what Chow is referring to
when he says, "most algebraic functions have no simple explicit
expression", and it is the reason he drops the word "algebraic" and
goes to a definition based on "purely transcendental".
</p>

<p class="a">
He goes on to define his class of
<span class="i">Exponential-Logarithmic numbers</span>, abbreviated EL or <span class="k">E</span>, as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29#Subfields_and_field_extensions">subfield</a> of the

<p class="a">
In his 1998 paper <a href="index-6.html#fn_chow1998">[4]</a>, Timothy Chow describes the
"Liouvillian numbers" <span class="k">L</span>. As with <span class="k">E</span> described above, they are a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29#Subfields_and_field_extensions">subfield</a> of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex numbers</a> <span class="k">C</span>. Referring
to the work of J. F. Ritt (see <a href="index-6.html#fn_ritt1923">[1]</a>, <a href="index-6.html#fn_ritt1948">[2]</a>), Chow wrote:
</p>

<p class="q">
  <span class="s">
  Ritt thought of elementary numbers as the smallest <span class="i">algebraically</span>
  <span class="i">closed</span> subfield <span class="k">L</span> of <span class="k">C</span> that is closed under exp and log. It so
  happens that terminology has evolved since Ritt, so that <span class="k">L</span> is now
  known as the field of <span class="i">Liouvillian</span> <span class="i">numbers</span>, and "elementary numbers"
  are now numbers that can be specified <span class="i">implicitly</span> as well as
  explicitly by exponential, logarithmic, and algebraic operations.

</p>
<p class="a">

By "algebraically closed", Chow means that all roots of polynomials
are in <span class="k">L</span>. So, for example, this included the roots of x<sup>4</sup>+x-3=0
(which can be solved for <span class="i">x</span>), and also the roots of x<sup>5</sup>-x+1=0
(which <span class="i">cannot</span> be solved for <span class="i">x</span>).
</p>
<p class="i">
  By "closed under exp and log", Chow means that if <span class="i">v</span> is any number
in <span class="k">L</span>, exp(<span class="i">v</span>) and log(<span class="i">v</span>) are also in <span class="k">L</span>. Thus <span class="k">L</span> includes
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">2</span><sup>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline">2</span></sup>; however it does not include the roots of <span class="i">x<sup>x</sup></span>=7 or
of cos(<span class="i">x</span>)-<span class="i">x</span>=0 because those equations are not "algebraic" and
cannot be solved for <span class="i">x</span> using the elementary functions.
</p>
<p class="i">
  Ritt's <span class="k">L</span> and Chow's <span class="k">E</span> differ only in that <span class="k">L</span> includes
implicitly defined algebraic numbers (like the roots of all
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_function">quintic polynomials</a>) while <span class="k">E</span> includes only
those that can be expressed in closed form.

<p class="a">
Use the <span class="k">ries</span> option <span class="m">-l</span> to search for solutions that areLiouvillian numbers. This option is like <span class="m">-a</span>, but permits the naturallogarithm and exponential functions, with any argument that does not
contain an <span class="i">x</span>. For example:
