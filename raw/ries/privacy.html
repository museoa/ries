<p class="a">
The <a href="index.html">RIES webpage</a> includes a live online number lookup service
(hereafter called "<span class="k">ORIES</span>", for "Online RILYBOT Inverse Equation
Solver".)
</p>

<p class="a">
In order to monitor for possible overuse or abuse by malicious users,
and in order to catch and fix any problems in the <span class="k">ORIES</span> software's
operations, all <span class="k">ORIES</span> requests (including the actual submitted
numbers) are stored in a private server log.
</p>

<p class="a">
As on any web server, information about all webpage requests,
including the requesting computer's IP address, browser version,
referring website if any, and other similar details, are also stored
in a private server log.
</p>

<p class="a">
At <span class="k">mrob.com</span>, we strive to respect the privacy of our users. We will
not use any of this information for any commercial purpose, or for any
other purpose apart from diagnosing problems, monitoring the total
level of usage, detecting abuse or misuse, determining which pages are
most or least popular, and for similar purposes. In all cases the
details of the information used will be kept private (except if
necessary to comply with a legal order).
</p>

<p class="a">
Notwithstanding the above, all stored data is subject to the risks of
any online computer system, including risks to privacy. For example
our web hosting provider could be attacked by remote "hackers"; there
could be an "inside job" by employees; or the premises could be
invaded by velociraptors.
</p>

<p class="a">
In addition, there is no encryption of the <span class="k">ORIES</span> submissions and
responses during transport (we use an <span class="m">http</span>, not <span class="m">https</span>, URL), sothe bad guys might be reading your numbers as they fly through the
internets.
</p>

<p class="a">
If you do not feel comfortable with the above, do not submit "private"
numbers to <span class="k">ORIES</span>, or refrain from using the <span class="k">ORIES</span> service
entirely.
</p>
